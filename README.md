We define the scope of HospitApp as the set of functionalities that the application is expected to have. Below are the expected features of the application:  

1. *User Registration**: The application will allow users to register. To do this, the user will be asked for their first name, last name, email, and password.  
2. *Login*: The application will allow users to log in. Users will be required to enter their email and password. Additionally, administrators will be able to log in with their credentials.  
3. *Search with Filters for Specialty, Health Insurance, Range, and Sorting by Proximity, Rating, and Promotions*: Users will be able to search for hospitals and clinics based on specialty, health insurance provider, distance range, and sort results by proximity, rating, and promotions.  
4. *Redirection to Google Maps or Waze*: Users will be able to redirect to Google Maps or Waze to get directions to the selected hospital or clinic.  
5. *Review System*: Users will be able to rate and leave reviews for hospitals and clinics.  
6. *Promotion System*: Hospitals and clinics will be able to request to publish promotions, which will be approved by the administrator.  
7. *IPS and Review Management System*: The administrator will be able to manage healthcare providers (IPS) and delete user reviews that violate the application's policies.  
8. *Location Scope*: For now, the location limit is defined as the entire territory of Antioquia.  

### Future Scope  

- *Review Reporting System*: Users will be able to report reviews that violate the application's policies.  
- *Hospital and Clinic Login System*: Hospitals and clinics will be able to log in to manage their information.  
- *Automatic Hospital and Clinic Update System*: The application will automatically update hospital and clinic information through web scraping and integration with government databases.



### *Code Principles for Next.js (Layered Architecture)*

1. *Variable Naming: Use **snake\_case* for all variables and function names, except for constants, which should be in *SCREAMING\_SNAKE\_CASE*.

   and for const shoud be like this \_CONST

   javascript
   const _API_URL = "https://api.example.com";
   const _MAX_RETRIES = 3;
   let user_session = getSession();
   

2. *Constants*: All constants must be declared in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE and should be stored in configuration files whenever possible.

   javascript
   export const DB_CONNECTION_STRING = "mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb";
   

3. *Componentization: It is recommended to **divide the UI into reusable components* inside the components/ folder.

   javascript
   import Button from "@/components/Button";
   

4. *Code and Comments in English: All code and comments must be written in **English* to ensure consistency and maintainability.

   javascript
   // Fetch user data from API
   

5. *Folder Structure*:

   - All folder names *must start in lowercase*.
   - Use a *layered structure* (components/, services/, utils/, pages/, etc.).



   plaintext
   â”œâ”€â”€ app/
        â”œâ”€â”€folder/
	    â”œâ”€â”€page
   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
   â”œâ”€â”€ services/
   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
        â”œâ”€â”€ api/

   
   

6. *Reusable Functions*:

   - Common methods like database connections should be placed in services/ or lib/.

   javascript
   import { db_connect } from "@/services/db";
   

7. *Organized Imports*:

   - Use absolute imports from the root (@/ instead of ../).
   - Avoid absolute imports for internal files.

   javascript
   import { db_connect } from "@/services/db";
   import { get_session } from "next-auth/react";
