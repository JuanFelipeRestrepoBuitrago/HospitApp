The reported bug was in the [Bug 01](https://github.com/users/KevinQzG/projects/5/views/9?filterQuery=bug&pane=issue&itemId=100699802&issue=KevinQzG%7CHospitApp%7C29). *Additional Note:* This bug was already fixed by Juan Felipe Restrepo.<br><br>Additionally, another [bug 02](https://github.com/users/KevinQzG/projects/5/views/9?filterQuery=bug&pane=issue&itemId=101710267&issue=KevinQzG%7CHospitApp%7C34) was found. The distance doesn't match the actual distance to the IPS because the user coordinates are not as accurate as the system needs them to be. This [bug 02](https://github.com/users/KevinQzG/projects/5/views/9?filterQuery=bug&pane=issue&itemId=101710267&issue=KevinQzG%7CHospitApp%7C34) should be fixed by Kevin Quiroz. *Additional Note:* This bug was already fixed by Kevin Quiroz. | Mac (Server) - Client (Google Chrome and Safari, Mac) |
